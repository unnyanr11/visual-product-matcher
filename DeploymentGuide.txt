🚀 Website Deployment Guide
===========================

📋 Preparation:
Make sure you already have the dist/ directory — this contains the final build of your website

💡 Deploy to Cloud Platforms (Recommended):

🌟 Vercel (vercel.com) – Easiest
1. Go to vercel.com and sign up
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Browse All Templates" → "Static"
4. Drag and drop the dist/ folder into the upload area
5. Enter a project name, click "Deploy"
6. Get a free HTTPS URL within minutes!

☁️ Cloudflare Pages (pages.cloudflare.com) – Fastest
1. Go to pages.cloudflare.com and log in
2. Click "Create a project" → "Upload assets"
3. Zip the dist/ folder
4. Upload the zip file
5. Set a project name, click "Deploy site"
6. Enjoy global CDN acceleration!

🔥 Netlify (netlify.com) – User-Friendly
1. Go to netlify.com and sign up
2. Drag and drop the dist/ folder into the homepage upload area
3. Wait for the upload to complete
4. You’ll get a random domain (can be customized in settings)

📘 GitHub Pages (pages.github.com) – Free & Reliable
1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Upload the contents of the dist/ folder to the repo
3. Go to repository Settings → Pages
4. Select "Deploy from a branch" → main branch
5. Access your site at username.github.io/repository-name

🔧 Advanced Deployment (For Developers):

Git-based Auto Deployment
1. Push the whole project (including source code) to GitHub/GitLab
2. Connect your repo with Vercel/Netlify
3. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: npm run build
   - Publish directory: dist
   - Node.js version: 16.x or higher
4. Every push will automatically trigger build & deployment

Traditional Server Deployment
If you have your own server:
1. Upload all files inside the dist/ directory to your server’s web root
2. Ensure the server supports static file hosting
3. Access your website via your domain
