🚀 Quick Start (Two Options):
Option 1: Direct Use (Recommended for Beginners)
1. Navigate to the dist/ directory
2. Double-click the index.html file
3. The website will open in your browser!

1. Make sure Node.js is installed (recommended version: 16+)
2. Open terminal/command line in the project root directory
3. Run: npm install
4. Run: npm start
5. The development server will automatically open in your browser

💡 Tips:
- The dist/ directory contains the optimized build and can be directly deployed to a server
- The root-level index.html is not the final version — always use the one inside dist/
- To modify the code, edit files inside src/ and rebuild the project
- The project uses TypeScript and Tailwind CSS tech stack
